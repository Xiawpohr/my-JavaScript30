    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team)

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    const person = {

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    captain.age = 20
    console.log(person, captain)
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 30})
    console.log(cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}
    // cap3.name = 'arthur'
    // console.log(cap3)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
